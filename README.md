# Configurations for software I use

> [!WARNING]
> I use those configs under Windows. Don't know how well they perform under other systems...

## VS Code

I will probably switch to nvim in the future... but right now we are stuck here.

## Nushell

Nushell is my shell of choice and I like to maintain a clean configuration for it.

### Dependencies

- [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
- [carapace](https://github.com/carapace-sh/carapace)

## PowerShell

> [!CAUTION]
> I dislike PowerShell as much as everyone who needs to use it frequently and experienced other shells. The main reason I maintain this config, is to exit it faster and make it a bit more friendly to use...
